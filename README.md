# Week 14 Homework: Model-View-Controller (MVC) Tech Blog

## Your Task

Your task this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Languages Used

- NodeJS
- Express
- Express-Handlebars
- Sequelize
- Express-Session
- MySQL

## Project Notes

All project requirements have been met (pretty sure!). Heroku deployment went pretty smooth with the jawsdb for MySQL database. Session timeout for inactivity (mouse click/keypress) is set to 15 mins.
